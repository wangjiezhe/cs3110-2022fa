(** [make ()] is a new promise and resolver. The promise is pending. *)

      [x]. *)

      value [x], meaning that [state p] will become [Resolved x].
      Requires: [p] is pending. *)

(** [p >>= c] registers callback [c] with promise [p].
      When the promise is resolved, the callback will be run
      on the promises's contents.  If the promise is never
      resolved, the callback will never run. *)
