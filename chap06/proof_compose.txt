let compose f g x = f (g x)
let ( << ) = compose



Theorem: (f << g) << h  =  f << (g << h)

Proof: By extensionality, we need to show
  ((f << g) << h) x  =  (f << (g << h)) x
for an arbitrary x.

  ((f << g) << h) x
=   { evaluation of << }
  (f << g) (h x)
=   { evaluation of << }
  f (g (h x))

and

  (f << (g << h)) x
=   { evaluation of << }
  f ((g << h) x)
=   { evaluation of << }
  f (g (h x))

So ((f << g) << h) x = f (g (h x)) = (f << (g << h)) x.
